      the data extract and does not have a visit_end_datetime, then set the visit_end_datetime
      to the datetime of the data pull.

  - name: visit_detail_type_concept_id
    description: Use this field to understand the provenance of the visit detail record,
      or where the record comes from.

  - name: provider_id
    description: There will only be one provider per  **visit** record and the ETL
      document should clearly state how they were chosen (attending, admitting, etc.).
      This is a typical reason for leveraging the VISIT_DETAIL table as even though
      each VISIT_DETAIL record can only have one provider, there is no limit to the
      number of VISIT_DETAIL records that can be associated to a VISIT_OCCURRENCE
      record.

  - name: care_site_id
    description: This field provides information about the Care Site where the Visit
      Detail took place.

  - name: visit_detail_source_value
    description: This field houses the verbatim value from the source data representing
      the kind of visit detail that took place (inpatient, outpatient, emergency,
      etc.)

  - name: visit_detail_source_concept_id
    description: No description provided

  - name: admitted_from_concept_id
    description: Use this field to determine where the patient was admitted from.
      This concept is part of the visit domain and can indicate if a patient was admitted
      to the hospital from a long-term care facility, for example.

  - name: admitted_from_source_value
    description: No description provided

  - name: discharged_to_source_value
    description: No description provided

  - name: discharged_to_concept_id
    description: Use this field to determine where the patient was discharged to after
      a visit. This concept is part of the visit domain and can indicate if a patient
      was transferred to another hospital or sent to a long-term care facility, for
      example.  It is assumed that a person is discharged to home therefore there
      is not a standard concept id for "home".  Use concept id = 0 when a person is
      discharged to home.

  - name: preceding_visit_detail_id
    description: Use this field to find the visit detail that occurred for the person
      prior to the given visit detail record. There could be a few days or a few years
      in between.

  - name: parent_visit_detail_id
    description: Use this field to find the visit detail that subsumes the given visit
      detail record. This is used in the case that a visit detail record needs to
      be nested beyond the VISIT_OCCURRENCE/VISIT_DETAIL relationship.

  - name: visit_occurrence_id
    description: Use this field to link the VISIT_DETAIL record to its VISIT_OCCURRENCE.

- name: visit_occurrence
  description: Auto-generated schema for the visit_occurrence table
  columns:
  - name: visit_occurrence_id
    description: Use this to identify unique interactions between a person and the
      health care system. This identifier links across the other CDM event tables
      to associate events with a visit.

  - name: person_id
    description: No description provided

  - name: visit_concept_id
    description: This field contains a concept id representing the kind of visit,
      like inpatient or outpatient. All concepts in this field should be standard
      and belong to the Visit domain.

  - name: visit_start_date
    description: For inpatient visits, the start date is typically the admission date.
      For outpatient visits the start date and end date will be the same.

  - name: visit_start_datetime
    description: No description provided

  - name: visit_end_date
    description: For inpatient visits the end date is typically the discharge date.  If
      a Person is still an inpatient in the hospital at the time of the data extract
      and does not have a visit_end_date, then set the visit_end_date to the date
      of the data pull.

  - name: visit_end_datetime
    description: If a Person is still an inpatient in the hospital at the time of
      the data extract and does not have a visit_end_datetime, then set the visit_end_datetime
      to the datetime of the data pull.

  - name: visit_type_concept_id
    description: Use this field to understand the provenance of the visit record,
      or where the record comes from.

  - name: provider_id
    description: There will only be one provider per visit record and the ETL document
      should clearly state how they were chosen (attending, admitting, etc.). If there
      are multiple providers associated with a visit in the source, this can be reflected
      in the event tables (CONDITION_OCCURRENCE, PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE, etc.) or in
      the VISIT_DETAIL table.

  - name: care_site_id
    description: This field provides information about the Care Site where the Visit
      took place.

  - name: visit_source_value
    description: This field houses the verbatim value from the source data representing
      the kind of visit that took place (inpatient, outpatient, emergency, etc.)

  - name: visit_source_concept_id
    description: No description provided

  - name: admitted_from_concept_id
    description: Use this field to determine where the patient was admitted from.
      This concept is part of the visit domain and can indicate if a patient was admitted
      to the hospital from a long-term care facility, for example.

  - name: admitted_from_source_value
    description: No description provided

  - name: discharged_to_concept_id
    description: Use this field to determine where the patient was discharged to after
      a visit. This concept is part of the visit domain and can indicate if a patient
      was transferred to another hospital or sent to a long-term care facility, for
      example.  It is assumed that a person is discharged to home therefore there
      is not a standard concept id for "home".  Use concept id = 0 when a person is
      discharged to home.

  - name: discharged_to_source_value
    description: No description provided

  - name: preceding_visit_occurrence_id
    description: Use this field to find the visit that occurred for the person prior
      to the given visit. There could be a few days or a few years in between.
